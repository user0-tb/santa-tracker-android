## About

[Google Santa Tracker app for Android][play-store] is an educational and entertaining tradition
that brings joy to millions of children (and children at heart) across the world over the December
holiday period.

The app is a companion to the [Google Santa Tracker][santa-web] website
([repository here](https://github.com/google/santa-tracker-web)), showcasing unique platform
capabilities like Android Wear watchfaces, device notifications and more.

## Features

* A beautiful designed village
* Exciting games like Penguin Swim and Rocket Sleigh
* Use of Dynamic Feature Modules (each game is a separate module, fetched dynamically on first run)
* Interactive Android Wear watchfaces (with sound!)
* Videos, animations and more.

## Building the app

First up, Santa Tracker is powered by [Firebase][firebase], so you'll need to enable it
on your Google account over at the [Firebase console][fire-console]. Once you're in the
console, follow these steps:

 * Create a new project
 * Add Firebase to your Android app
 * Package name: `com.google.android.apps.santatracker.debug`
 * Debug signing certificate can be blank, or follow the instructions in the tooltip to find yours.
 * Save the `google-services.json` file to the `santa-tracker/` directory

Now you should be able to plug your phone in (or fire up an emulator) and run:

    ./gradlew santa-tracker:installDebug

Alternatively, import the source code into Android Studio (File, Import Project).

Note: You'll need Android SDK version 28. If you're unsure about this, use
Android Studio and tick the appropriate boxes in the SDK Manager.
